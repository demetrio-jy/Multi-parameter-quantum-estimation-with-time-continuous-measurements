# Multi-parameter-quantum-estimation-with-time-continuous-measurements

This repository contains the code I developed for my MSc thesis and the obtained data.

The code is written in Julia and simulates different types of continuous measurements on two types of two-parameters hamiltonians. 
The states describing the hamiltonians are qubit like.
The Fisher Information, Quantum Fisher Information and Ultimate Quantum Information are calculated.
The data are analyzed in Python in the reported Jupyter Notebooks.
