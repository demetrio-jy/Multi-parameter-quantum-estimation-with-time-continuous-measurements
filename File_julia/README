This folder contains the necessary to simulate the dynamics of a qubit affected by 
continuous measurement and obtain the QFI, the FI for continuous measurement and the 
FI for a strong measurement on the conditioned state in the case where the Hamiltonian 
determining the free dynamics depends on two parameters.
The modulus of Uhlmann curvature is also derived.



The cases investigated are the following:

	hamiltonian type		operator measured		reference world

>	2 indipendent frequencies	sigma -				Fluorescence
>	2 indipendent frequencies	sigma z
>	2 indipendent frequencies	sigma x & sigma y
>	rotating field			sigma -



To execute the programme run the command:

> julia ContinuousMeasurement(reference world).jl



Data file are organized as follow:

time 	FI_11 	FI_12	FI_22	FIC_11	FIC_12	FIC_22	QFI_11	QFI_12	QFI_22	absD_12
